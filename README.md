Forest Fire Prediction Using Linear Regression
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood and intensity of forest fires based on various environmental and meteorological features. The goal is to provide an early warning system to assist forest management and firefighting authorities in monitoring and preventing potential fire outbreaks.

The project demonstrates the practical application of Linear Regression for predicting numerical outcomes (e.g., burned area) and integrates a simple Flask web application to deploy the model locally, allowing users to input feature values and obtain predictions through a user-friendly interface.

Key Features

Predictive Modeling:

Uses Linear Regression to predict forest fire severity based on features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant environmental factors.

Provides numerical predictions for the burned area or fire intensity.

Interactive Web Interface:

Built with Flask, allowing local deployment on localhost.

Users can enter environmental parameters through a web form and get immediate predictions.

Data Handling & Preprocessing:

Efficient use of Pandas for data loading, cleaning, and preparation.

Handles feature scaling and transformation where necessary for improved model performance.

Visualization & Insights (optional enhancement):

Provides charts or tables summarizing input features and predicted fire intensity.

Helps in understanding feature importance and trends influencing forest fires.

Workflow

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Collect historical forest fire data with environmental features.

Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.

Model Training

Apply Linear Regression to train the model on historical data.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or RÂ² score.

Flask Deployment

Build a simple Flask app with input forms for environmental features.

Integrate the trained Linear Regression model for predictions.

Launch the application locally for user interaction via web browser.

Prediction & Output

Users input environmental conditions.

The app returns the predicted forest fire intensity or burned area.
